<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">For
many years, savings and loan banks (S&amp;Ls) were small outfits that
assisted Americans on a household scale. These <a href="/evidence">thrift banks</a>,
as they are known, </FONT>became a force in the
early 20th century by assisting with home ownership. Their focus on
mortgage lending, saving, and basic investing (typically through
passbook savings accounts and certificates of deposit) solidified
their reputation as a sleepy, yet vital, mainstay of the American
community. (S&amp;Ls of this era were famously depicted in the 1946
film <I>It&rsquo;s a Wonderful Life</I>).<FONT COLOR="#2c1614">
However, some in the industry were eager to expand beyond the
household. In the 1960s and especially 70s, they pushed Congress for
deregulation of S&amp;Ls. Industry leaders wanted to be able to act
more like full-fledged banks, investing in large ventures with the
latitude to make riskier investments &ndash; and the goal of higher
profits. On March 31</FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"><SUP>st</SUP></FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">,
1980, those advocates got their wish when President Carter signed the
</FONT>Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act.
The law gave them many of the same capabilities as banks, but without
comparable regulation. <FONT COLOR="#2c1614">The Federal Home Loan
Bank Board (FHLBB), responsible for regulating S&amp;Ls, was suddenly
faced with a seismic shift in how its industry did business. Both the
regulators and the banks were uncertain of the new areas they were
moving into &ndash; but both knew it would surely involve more than
local car loans and basic savings accounts.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">One
banker who was particularly eager to take advantage of the newly
liberalized rules was </FONT><A HREF="/actors/affiliates/Charles-Keating"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Charles
Keating</FONT></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">, the President of the
home construction company American Continental Corporation (</FONT><A HREF="/actors/affiliates/ACC"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">ACC</FONT></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">).
In 1984, ACC bought </FONT><A HREF="/actors/affiliates/Lincoln-Savings-and-Loan"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Lincoln
Savings &amp; Loan</FONT></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">, an
Irvine, California thrift bank. Over a few
short years, Keating turned the operation from one that resembled the
community S&amp;L portrayed in </FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"><I>It&rsquo;s
a Wonderful Life</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"> to a lavish and
high-flying operation. Keating effectively eliminated traditional,
low-risk home lending. He established a high-risk operation
characterized by explosive growth and excessive concentrations in
speculative activities. After moving the operation to Arizona, he
became the highest paid executive of all the publically traded
companies in the state (with five other ACC employees being in the
top ten).</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">Around
the same time that Keating purchased Lincoln, </FONT><A HREF="/actors/supporting_cast/Ed-Gray"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Ed
Gray</FONT></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"> was appointed Chair of
the 3-member FHLBB. </FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"><I>The Washington
Post </I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">reported that, &ldquo;Gray was
neither an economist nor a businessman by profession, but rather a
born pitchman and cheerleader. After a brief episode as a reporter,
working in the Madrid bureau of United Press International during the
early 1960s, he went into public relations and made a career of
saying positive things about his employees&hellip; this decidedly
average man &ndash; brown hair, square face, medium height and build
&ndash; instinctively shunned controversy and conflict.&rdquo;</FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"><SUP>1</SUP></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">As
Gray stepped into this leadership position, the savings and loan
(S&amp;L) industry was beginning to crack. Lending companies were
overextending themselves, with one after another starting to go
bankrupt as numerous high-risk loans soured. In an effort to reduce
the fallout, Gray proposed a number of reforms and regulations.
These, however, proved extremely unpopular among the leaders of the
thrift industry &ndash; especially Keating. One of the regulations
Gray proposed were caps on &ldquo;direct investments,&rdquo; which
often represented risky real estate ventures initiated by the thrift.
In the past, thrifts&rsquo; involvement in the real estate industry
was indirect, via homeowners&rsquo; mortgages and builders&rsquo;
loans. Direct investments were direct cash injections into
large-scale building projects that were high reward, but also
high-risk. In this way, Gray broke away from industry trends and
forged a more fiscally conservative path with concern to S&amp;Ls. In
December 1985, Keating attempted to hire Gray out of his FHLBB
position. Gray refused the offer and reported Keating to the Justice
Department.</FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"><SUP>2</SUP></FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">Gray&rsquo;s
ethics had been called into question by allegations about
inappropriate use of government funds.  In December 1986, it was
<a href="/files/evidence/6">reported</a> that Gray has been using FHLBB funds for
his wife to accompany him on business trips across the nation. While
Gray repaid the FHLBB for those costs &ldquo;on [his] own volition,&rdquo;
they amounted to over $11,000. He had also previously repaid $13,000
for a private jet he chartered to see his dying father while across
the country on FHLBB business.</FONT></P>

1986, the Bank Board began its first major examination of Lincoln in
two years. (The last examination, conducted six months after Keating
acquired Lincoln, revealed &ldquo;appraisal difficulties,&rdquo;) &ldquo;an
overvaluation of capital,&rdquo; and a &ldquo;lack of an internal
audit committee.&rdquo; Keating claimed that the examination was
months overdue and that the FHLBB was harassing him and leaking
information to discredit him for being publically critical of Gray.
The <a href="/actors/supporting_cast/SF-Regulators">FHLBB regulators</a>, based in San Francisco, claimed
that, under the circumstances, the Lincoln examination was not
unusually long. In his testimony to the Senate Ethics Committee,
William Black, one of the regulators, explained how &ldquo;when a
thrift has engaged in complex transactions, is troubled, or does not
cooperate, the examination takes longer.&rdquo; All three of these
complications applied to Lincoln's case. The examination dealt with
unusually complicated tax agreements, potentially &ldquo;troubled&rdquo;
real estate holdings, and many &ldquo;junk bond&rdquo; investments.</FONT></P>

For two weeks, Lincoln&rsquo;s executives refused to permit the
examination to continue. Then, Keating insisted that the examiners
conduct their examination through Lincoln's New York litigation

with the proviso that Lincoln's counsel move to Phoenix.</FONT></P>

August, the </FONT><A HREF="/actors/supporting_cast/SF-Regulators"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">San

summarized their preliminary findings of Lincoln's exam in a
&ldquo;Statement of Supervisory Concerns&rdquo; and sent a draft to
Washington. It detailed many areas of worry: underwriting
deficiencies, appraisal deficiencies, improperly capitalized
interest, $600 million in excess direct investments,
misclassification of joint ventures, false profits, and over
concentrations of loans to one borrower. Fieldwork continued on the
examination of Lincoln. In late September, </FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"><I>The
Washington Post</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"> ran a <a href="/files/evidence/4">story</a> about the delay of Lincoln's examination and &ldquo;the
feud&rdquo; between Keating and Gray. Describing the two as
&ldquo;embroiled in a bitter feud over the future of the troubled S&amp;L
industry,&rdquo; it highlighted Lincoln&rsquo;s accusation that the
Bank Board leaked confidential information and was conducting an
unusually long audit to discredit Keating, who was a staunch
supporter of deregulation. It then cited sources that allegedly knew
what Gray&rsquo;s viewpoint: That the FHLBB&rsquo;s job was to
investigate wrongdoing, no matter how long it takes and that Gray
already sees Keating as an unethical character. Having had no direct
contact with Lincoln&rsquo;s exam, Gray was confused about the story
and its allegations. He wrote to the San Francisco regulators for an
explanation. Three days later, Gray received the so-called &ldquo;</FONT><A HREF="/files/evidence/21"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Cirona
memo</FONT></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">&rdquo; &ndash; a lengthy
explanation of the concerns addressed in the draft Statement of
Supervisory Concerns, along with details about how Keating had
impeded the examination. The FHLBB ended its fieldwork a few weeks
later. While still working on the final Statement of Supervisory
Concerns, on February 3, 1987, the San Francisco regulators forwarded
the Bank Board a summary of its review of Lincoln&rsquo;s securities
transactions and related corporations.</FONT></P>

regarding their Senate motion to disqualify Ed Gray from the Bank
Board by late February. Keating and Grogan wanted Gray gone as soon
as possible out of fear that he would try to push through additional
regulations right before his term ended. Additionally, even if the
President chose to reappoint, they wanted the Senate to know about
Gray&rsquo;s past ethical mistakes and why they thought he was taking
the S&amp;L industry in the wrong direction. Around the same time,
Grogan and </FONT><A HREF="/actors/affiliates/Jack-Atchison"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Jack

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">It
was Gray, however, who first initiated contact between the senators

Gray says that, around that time, he was talking to &ldquo;anyone who
would listen&rdquo; about a FHLBB recapitalization bill he was about
to put before Congress. Gray wanted appropriations for one of the
FHLBB&rsquo;s subsidiaries (the FSLIC) that took over failing S&amp;Ls.
Congress had voted down a previous iteration in October and reserves
were falling quickly. Gray said that the FSLIC would fall near the $1
billion level in early 1987; it should have had reserves of at least
$7 billion to properly insure S&amp;Ls. According to Gray, at the end
of the meeting Riegle pulled him aside and told him that there were
senators out West who were concerned about the Bank Board&rsquo;s
actions on </FONT><A HREF="/actors/affiliates/Lincoln-Savings-and-Loan"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">Lincoln</FONT></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">,
and that these senators wanted to meet with Gray. Gray says he told
Riegle that he didn't like the idea; he had had enough headaches with
Keating. In what Gray describes as a three-minute meeting, he
expressed his belief that nothing productive would come of sitting
down with the senators. According to Gray, Rielge simply responded:</FONT></P>

later, around the time the senators received copies of the <a href="/files/exhibits/Lincoln/%233%20Arthur%20Young%20Letter%2003-17-87.pdf">Arthur

federal regulators were &ldquo;harassing&rdquo; Lincoln by being
&ldquo;unduly harsh.&rdquo; Grogan claims that Riegle told him a

DeConcini, McCain, Cranston, and Glenn. (Years later, McCain recalled
that DeConcini started the meeting with a reference to &ldquo;our

unfortunate choice of words, which Gray would remember and repeat

claims that he was told not to bring any. This was uncommon; usually,
he brought at least one aide, who would take notes at all meetings he
attended. McCain received similar instructions to attend the meeting
without his aide. McCain stationed his assistant (VanPaaschen)
outside the room in case he had any substantive questions. Neither
Cranston nor Glenn brought an aide, but it was not unusual for Glenn
to attend such meetings alone. The evidence is unclear about the
origin of the command for &ldquo;no aides.&rdquo; DeConcini denies
the existence of such an order. We know, however, know who initiated
the meeting. After stressing for several weeks that he was not at the

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">For
Keating, the meeting was a bust. Gray told the senators that, as head
of the Bank Board, he was only concerned with the big picture of the
S&amp;L industry; he didn't have specific information about Lincoln &ndash;
only the San Francisco regulators would. Many of the meeting&rsquo;s
attendees recalled the senators&rsquo; frustration (especially
Glenn&rsquo;s) with Gray&rsquo;s lack of information. From the
senators&rsquo; perspective, Gray knew specifically why they wanted
to meet with him. Despite not being personally involved in the
examination, he had time to get information on Keating and Lincoln
and yet showed up empty-handed. Gray offered to set up a meeting
between the senators and the San Francisco regulators, noting during
testimony that he was preoccupied with staying on the senators&rsquo;
&ldquo;good side&rdquo; during that time so that the FHLBB
recapitalization bill could get passed.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">A
day or two after the meeting, DeConcini told Gray the senators were
interested in meeting with the regulators. Gray&rsquo;s office

Keating got word of this, he put plans into motion. He sent Grogan to
Washington, along with a revised &ldquo;Schedule&rdquo; of Lincoln&rsquo;s complaints and offerings, with instructions

saw this second meeting as an opportunity to raise additional issues.

testified that both he and McCain agreed to the invitation. (Sedlmayr
says that she was rushed to put this letter together at the end of
the day, and that she forgot to take it to McCain&rsquo;s office to
have it signed). With the invitation accepted, the four senators,
along with Riegle, attended the second meeting. Also at the meeting
were William Black, then Deputy Director of the Federal Savings and
Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), the FHLBB subsidiary that Gray&rsquo;s

Black described the meeting as a &ldquo;show of force&rdquo; by
Keating, who wanted the senators to pressure the regulators into
dropping their case against Lincoln. The thrift was in trouble for
violating &ldquo;direct investment&rdquo; rules, which prohibited
S&amp;Ls from taking large ownership stakes in risky ventures. &ldquo;The
Senate is a really small club, like the clich&eacute; goes,&rdquo;
Black said. &ldquo;And you really did have one-twentieth of the
Senate in one room, called by one guy, who was the biggest crook in

accomplished their goal &ldquo;if they had simply had us show up and

<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">According
to nearly verbatim notes taken by Black, McCain started the second
meeting with a careful comment. &ldquo;One of our jobs as elected
officials is to help constituents in a proper fashion,&rdquo; McCain
said. &ldquo;ACC [Lincoln&rsquo;s parent company] is a big employer
and important to the local economy. I wouldn't want any special
favors for them&hellip; I don't want any part of our conversation to
be improper.&rdquo; Black claimed the comment had the opposite effect
for the regulators; it made them nervous about what might really be
the senators&rsquo; intentions. Glenn, a former astronaut and the
first American to orbit the Earth, was not as tactful. &ldquo;You
should charge them or get off their backs,&rdquo; he told the
regulators. &ldquo;If things are bad there, get to them. Their view
is that they took a failing business and put it back on its feet.
It&rsquo;s now viable and profitable. They took it off the endangered
species list. Why has the exam dragged on and on and on?&rdquo;
DeConcini then added: &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with this if they&rsquo;re
willing to clean up their act?&rdquo;</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">Cirona,
the banking official, told the senators that it was &ldquo;very
unusual&rdquo; to hold a meeting to discuss a particular company.
DeConcini shot back: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very unusual for us to have a
company that could be put out of business by its regulators.&rdquo;
In the middle of the meeting, the regulators came forward and told
the senators that Lincoln was in trouble. Prior to that, there were
doing their best to tell the senators what they wanted to hear.
Patriarca told the senators that the regulators were sending a
criminal referral to the Department of Justice, and that the senators
could not breathe a word of it to Lincoln. They also told the
senators that they have had problems with Arthur Young&rsquo;s

considering disciplinary action against them, too. The meeting then
ended abruptly. Grogan says that Glenn returned to his office, where
Grogan waited during the meeting, and simply told Grogan not to
expect much from the Bank Board. Keating himself did not try to
interact further with the regulators or the Bank Board.</FONT></P>

May, the San Francisco regulators finished a yearlong audit and
recommended that Lincoln&rsquo;s assets be seized. The audit, which
described Lincoln as a thrift reeling out of control, ended up

to Keating, had recently replaced Gray as chairman. In September, the
investigation was taken away from the San Francisco office, which
included Black and Patriarca. In May of 1988, it was transferred to
Washington, where Lincoln would be audited again. Back in San
Francisco, Black was fuming. &ldquo;Clearly, we were shot in the
back,&rdquo; he would later say. Despite the reprieve, Keating&rsquo;s
businesses continued to spiral downward, taking the five Senators&rsquo;
reputations with them.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">In
April 1989, two years after the Keating Five meetings, the government
seized Lincoln, which declared bankruptcy. In September 1990, Keating
was placed into Los Angeles County Jail, charged with 42 counts of
fraud. His bond was set at $5 million. During Keating&rsquo;s trial,
the prosecution produced a parade of elderly investors who lost their
life&rsquo;s savings by investing in ACC junk bonds. Keating was
convicted in both Federal and state courts of many counts of fraud,
racketeering, and conspiracy. He served four-and-a-half years in
prison before both convictions were overturned in 1996 because flawed
jury instructions in both cases violated Keating&rsquo;s due-process
rights. In 1999, he pled guilty to a more limited set of wire and
bankruptcy fraud counts, and was sentenced to the time he had already
served.</FONT></P>

and Lincoln became convenient symbols for arguments about what had
gone wrong in America's financial system, but the senators did not
escape infamy either. By the spring of 1990, a deck of playing cards
was being marketed, called the &ldquo;Savings and Loan Scandal,&rdquo;
that featured on their face Keating holding up his hand, with images
of the five senators portrayed as puppets on his fingers. Polls
showed that most Americans believed the actions of the Keating Five
were typical of Congress as a whole. The only difference, according
to political historian Lewis Gould&rsquo;s book </FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614"><I>The
Most Exclusive Club</I></FONT><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">, was that those
involved in the scandal had been caught.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">McCain
testified against Keating in a civil suit brought by Lincoln
bondholders, and was seen as the plaintiffs&rsquo; best witness. The
other four senators refused to testify. Cranston left office in
January 1993, and died in December 2000. He received the harshest
penalty of the five senators, being formally reprimanded by the
Ethics Committee during a formal session of the full Senate, with
almost all 100 senators present. DeConcini and Riegle served in
Senate until their terms expired, but did not seek re-election in
1994. Glenn did choose to run for re-election in 1992, winning, and
served until 1999. After that time, the only member of the Keating
Five remaining in the Senate was John McCain. McCain eventually
became the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 and remains in the
Senate to this day. During the early 2000s, several retrospective
accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was
included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at
least one Republican target.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="text-indent: 0.44in; margin-bottom: 0"><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">The
scandal was followed by a number of attempts to adopt campaign
finance reform, but most died in committee. A weakened reform was
passed in 1993. Substantial campaign finance reform was not passed
until the adoption of the McCain-Feingold Act in 2002. Robert
Bennett, special counsel for the Senate Ethics Committee during the
scandal, would later write that the Keating Five investigation did
make a difference, as members of Congress were afterward far less
likely to intercede in Federal investigations on behalf of
contributors.</FONT></P>

early October 2008, the Keating Five scandal, its possible parallel
to the subprime mortgage and liquidity crisis of that September, and
specifically the role in the scandal of Republican presidential
nominee McCain, were briefly emphasized by the campaign of Democratic
opponent, Barack Obama, through a 13-minute &ldquo;</FONT><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDofbll86dY"><FONT COLOR="#be0006"><FONT FACE="Times, serif">documentary</FONT></FONT></A><FONT COLOR="#2c1614">&rdquo;

little impact on McCain's eventually unsuccessful campaign.</FONT></P>
