<p><u>Senator Riegle's Aide</u></p>

<p>Kevin C. Gottlieb was longtime aide and campaign manager for <a href="/actors/senators/Don-Riegle">
Senator Riegle</a>. He participated with Riegle in meetings about
<a href="/actors/affiliates/Lincoln-Savings-and-Loan">Lincoln S&L</a>. Gottlieb
was later involved in Riegle's defense of his role in the affair, which
was undercut by the fact that Riegle stressed for several weeks in
January 1990 that he was not at the now-infamous April 2nd meeting
with <a href="/actors/supporting_cast/Ed-Gray">Ed Gray</a>, only to later be
forced to acknowledge that the session may have been arranged at his suggestion.
Gottlieb resigned soon after that announcement and returned to the private sector.
Gottlieb denied that his resignation was connected to the Keating Five affair.</p>
