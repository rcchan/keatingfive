<p><u>Senator DiConcini's Banking Aide</u></p>
<p>In January of 1978, Sedlmayr began working full-time for
DeConcini. Her first recollection of contact with Keating or ACC was in
1984. Both evidence and her testimony suggest that, as early as
December 1986, she warned DeConcini to “stay out of” the
Keating/Gray feud. Still, she remained a key go-between player for
Keating and DeConcini.</p>
<p>On behalf of DeConcini and McCain, Sedlmayr prepared the
memo to Senator Riegle, which invited him to attend the second
meeting. McCain claimed that he and his staff had no knowledge of
this memo, and Sedlmayr admits that she forgot to bring the memo to
McCain’s office to be signed before sending it to Riegle.</p>
