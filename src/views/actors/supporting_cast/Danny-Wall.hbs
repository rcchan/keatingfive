<p><u>FHLBB Chairman</u></p>

<p>Danny Wall was the <a href="/actors/supporting_cast/FHLBB">FHLBB</a> Chairman
that succeeded <a href="/actors/supporting_cast/Ed-Gray">Ed Gray</a> in mid-1987,
after Gray had stepped down from his post. Some say Wall was more sympathetic to
<a href="/actors/affiliates/Charles-Keating">Charles Keating</a>. Wall
<a href="/files/evidence/48">dismissed</a> efforts for Congressional action on the
burgeoning scandal. At the time, the House Banking Committee Chairman asked President
Bush to dismiss him. Under his Chairmanship, the Bank Board did not follow the
<a href="/actors/supporting_cast/SF-Regulators">San Francisco officialsâ€™</a>
recommendation to seize <a href="/actors/affiliates/Lincoln-Savings-and-Loan">Lincoln</a>.
Mr. Wall said that there was insufficient proof to justify the action.</p>
