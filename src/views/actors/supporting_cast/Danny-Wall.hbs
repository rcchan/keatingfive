<h2>Danny Wall</h2>



<p>FHLBB Chairman that succeeded Edwin Gray in mid-1987, after 
Gray had stepped down from his post. Some say Wall was more 
sympathetic to Keating. As the time, the House Banking Committee 
Chairman asked President Bush to dismiss him. Under his 
Chairmanship, the Bank Board did not follow the San Francisco officialsâ€™
recommendation to seize Lincoln. Mr. Wall said that there was 
insufficient proof to justify the action.</p>
