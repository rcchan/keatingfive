<h2>Danny Wall</h2><br />
<u>FHLBB Chairman</u><br /><br />

<p>Wall was the FHLBB Chairman that succeeded Edwin Gray in mid-1987, after
Gray had stepped down from his post. Some say Wall was more
sympathetic to Keating. Wall dismissed efforts for Congressional action on the
burgeoning scandal. At the time, the House Banking Committee
Chairman asked President Bush to dismiss him. Under his
Chairmanship, the Bank Board did not follow the San Francisco officialsâ€™
recommendation to seize Lincoln. Mr. Wall said that there was
insufficient proof to justify the action.</p>
