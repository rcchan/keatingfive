<h2>Lee H. Henkel Jr.</h2>

<p>FHLBB Board Member</p>
<p>
The Reagan Administration appointed Henkel to the FHLBB in late
1986 after lobbying by Keating. Henkel was named through a recess 
appointment, meaning that he did not require Senate confirmation. He 
proposed new regulations in his first meeting on the FHLBB. Many saw 
these new rules, while technically applicable to all Federally chartered 
S&Ls, as specifically targeted to benefit Lincoln. Henkel vigorously 
denies these allegations. He resigned from the FHLBB only five months 
later, shortly after it was revealed that he had several large loans from 
Lincoln, saying he needed to protect his family from the intense media 
scrutiny. Henkel later reached an agreement with the FHLBB’s 
successor agency that banned him from the banking and thrift 
industries. However, he neither admitted nor denied the charges, and 
continues to “categorically den[y] any wrongdoing.”1
Henkel said he agreed to the settlement only to avoid the cost of litigation.</p>
