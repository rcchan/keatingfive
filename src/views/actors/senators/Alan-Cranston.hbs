<img src="/img/actors/Alan-Cranston.jpg" alt="Sen. Alan Cranston" class="float-left">
<p>Senator Cranston (D, CA)</p><p>Senator Alan Cranston was born and raised in Northern California. After serving in the Army and writing two failed novels, Cranston co-founded in 1952 the California Democratic Council[1] &nbsp;and served as its chairman until 1957. In 1958 and 1962, he was elected California State Controller and in 1968 he became a California State Senator. He served four six-year terms in that position, and was the Democratic Whip from 1977 to 1991. In 1984, he ran an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, which left him with a $2 million debt. He was the second-ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee.</p><p>So why would Cranston, a leading liberal who called for a nuclear freeze and higher social spending, team up with <a href="/actors/affiliates/Charles-Keating" title="" target="">Charles Keating</a>, the arch-conservative Arizona businessman, who trumpeted his devotion to the free market and crusades against pornography and abortion? It’s hard to say. <a href="/actors/affiliates/Lincoln-Savings-and-Loan" title="" target="">Lincoln S&amp;L</a> was headquartered in California, and Cranston was, in his own words, a "longtime friend" of California's financial institutions. He says that even before meeting Keating, he was a long time supporter of direct investment.&nbsp;</p><p>Cranston and Keating overcame their differences and developed a mutually beneficial relationship. "Ah, the mutual aid society," Cranston affectionately greeted Keating on a tarmac in Los Angeles; Keating jetted in days before the 1986 election to provide papers for a last-minute $300,000 line of credit for Cranston’s campaign. (Cranston never tapped the line of credit.) Keating and associates gave $39,000 to Cranston's 1986 re-election campaign and arranged $85,000 in corporate contributions to the California Democratic Party for a get-out-the-vote drive. Keating's contributions to Cranston totaled almost $1 million; but they were mostly directed to voter registration groups, a kind of loophole for Cranston and Keating (for whom it was a tax deduction).&nbsp;</p><p>Due to illness, Cranston did not testify at the 1990 Senate Ethics hearings. His chief fundraiser, <a href="/actors/aides/Joy-Jacobson" title="" target="">Joy Jacobson</a>, and his banking aide, <a href="/actors/aides/Carolyn-Jordan" title="" target="">Carolyn Jordan</a>, were questioned during the hearing. After serving him for six years, Jacobson left Cranston’s senate staff in April of 1985 to become his chief fundraiser. From the beginning of Cranston’s relationship with Keating until mid 1987, his chief legal aide, <a href="/actors/affiliates/James-Grogan" title="" target="">Jim Grogan</a>, set up substantive meetings with Keating through Jacobson.. When asked why she would attend meetings that did not concern fundraising, Jacobson answered, “My constituency is contributors, and my responsibility is to see that those contributors feel as though somebody cares about their existence.” Documents show that she accompanied Cranston to numerous meetings of substantive nature. Grogan even sent her a letter (the same one he sent to DeConcini and Riegle’s office), which solicited advice regarding Ed Gray’s recusal (she says she never received it). In January 1987, she sent a <a href="/files/evidence/16" title="" target="">memo</a> to Senator Cranston that listed the names of contributors and the legislative matters with which they were concerned. In her words, “Individuals who have been helpful rightfully expected some kind of response from our office”…Jacobson claims that she had no knowledge of the April meetings until she read about them in the press.&nbsp;</p><p>Soon after the April 1987 meetings, Keating contributed $125,000 to USA Votes.[2] &nbsp; This was followed a few months later by $325,000 to the Forum Institute. In February 1988, while Cranston was visiting the Phoenician with his son Kim, Keating gave $400,000 to the Center for Participation in Democracy. (Cranston chided Jacobson for <a href="/files/evidence/25">advising</a> him to ask Keating for “only” $250,000).</p><p>His banking aide, Carolyn Jordan, also claims that she had no knowledge of the April meetings until a year later when she read about them in the press (during this period in April, she was in AZ and CA visiting Lincoln and other thrifts). Until after the April meetings, she had much less direct contact with Lincoln than Jacobson did. She says that she did not think it was unusual for Cranston to meet with the head of an agency, much less to do so without telling her. She recalls telling Cranston after the April meetings that criminal referrals were mechanisms, commonly used by the bank board, to scare off members of congress and attorneys and that a criminal referral did not mean the investigative process had stopped.&nbsp;</p><p>Per Cranston’s request, Jordan started investigating the sale of Lincoln in May1988. In a phone call made that month, Grogan told her that the FHLBB decided to take enforcement action against Lincoln despite admission that their examiners had committed fraud against <a href="/actors/affiliates/ACC" title="" target="">ACC</a>. She then called a friend at the FHLBB, who confirmed this information. Throughout this time, papers frequently reported Lincoln’s monetary gains: as late as February1988, Thrift News ranked Lincoln 39 of 100 in terms of net worth. Still, Jordan admits that she never made any attempts to substantiate Keating’s claims&mdash;in her words, “We tended not to try to say who is right and wrong. What we try to do is massage the process so these people could work out these difficulties.”</p>
