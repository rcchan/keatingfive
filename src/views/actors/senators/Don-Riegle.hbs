<p>Senator Riegle (D, MI)&nbsp;</p><p>Born in Flint, Michigan, Donald W. Riegle Jr. began his political career as a U.S. Representative in 1966. He was subsequently re-elected as a Republican congressman in the following three elections from Michigan's 7th congressional district. In 1973, due to differences with the Nixon administration regarding Vietnam and civil right, Riegle changed party affiliations and became a Democrat In 1977, he was elected to the U.S. Senate and remained in that position until 1994. While in the Senate, Riegle served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs and was a member of the Senate Committee on Finance.&nbsp;</p><p>What was <a href="https://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/actors/affiliates/keating" title="" target="">Charles Keating's</a> connection to Riegle and Michigan? Before Riegle and Keating met, Keating invested $37 million dollars in Riegle's state by building the Ponchetrain Hotel in Detroit. The two were first introduced at the grand opening of the hotel in March 1985. In the summer of 1986, Keating and his chief legal aid, James Grogan, met with Riegle on two separate occasions: first, to discuss Lee Henkel's nomination to the Bank Board, and, second, to propose that a fundraiser be held for Riegle's at the Ponchetrain. Riegle claims there was also talk of building a second hotel in Detroit.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Earlier that year, on March 6, Bank Board Chair <a href="https://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/actors/supporting_cast/ed-gray" title="" target="">Ed Gray</a> set up a meeting with Senator Riegle. Gray says that, around this time, he was talking to "anyone who would listen" &nbsp;about the FSLIC recapitalization bill he was about to put before Congress. According to Gray, Riegle pulled him aside at the end of the meeting and told him that there were senators out West who were concerned about the Bank Board's actions regarding <a href="https://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/actors/affiliates/lincoln" title="" target="">Lincoln S&amp;L</a>, and that these senators wanted to meet with Gray. Gray says he told Riegle that he didn't like the idea; he had had enough drama with Keating and Lincoln after the series of articles (<a href="https://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/evidence" title="" target="">see Evidence: Media</a>) that described a feud between Keating and Gray and simultaneously questioned Gray's reputation. In what Gray describes as a three-minute meeting, he expressed his belief that nothing productive would come of it. According to Gray, Rielge simply responded, "You'll be getting a call." "What?" "You'll be getting a call." Rielge has no independent recollection of what occurred in his March 6 meeting with Gray.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The next day, Riegle flew to Arizona (Keating had invited him to come see Lincoln's operationsâ€”too important to be in parentheses). After touring their headquarters, Keating and Rielge met privately. While Riegle does not remember what was said in this meeting, he speculates that if Keating had talked about his issues with the bank board, Glenn would have said, "Anybody outside my state and whose problems are outside Michigan would have to take up their with their home state senators." A member of Riegle's staff, Kevin Gottlieb, who waited outside with Grogan while the meeting took place, recalls that as Keating emerged to escort Riegle back to his car, he was informed that Keating's camp would begin arranging for Riegle's fundraiser at the Ponchetrain hotel.<br></p><p>On March 13rd, Riegle received the Arthur Young letter (<a href="http://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/evidence/download/20" title="" target="">Exhibit #256</a>). When asked why he would have received a letter like that, Riegle speculated that he may have made a passing comment to Grogan (when Grogan and Attchison were in DC in late February to lobby for Direct investment laws) that he was too busy to meet and put into writing their complaints. A few days after receiving the letter, Grogan met with Riegle in D.C.. Grogan claims that Riegle told him that a meeting between Ed Gray and the senators would occur and that Grogan needed either <a href="https://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/actors/senators/Dennis-DeConcini" title="" target="">Senator DeConcini</a> or <a href="https://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/actors/senators/John-McCain" title="" target="">Senator McCain</a> to invite him to this meeting. Riegle has no recollection of this conversation. A little more than a week later, a successful fundraiser at the Ponchetrain hotel was held (March 23rd) and raised over $30,000 on Riegle's behalf. Riegle returned these contributions a few weeks later after the Detroit papers ran a story connecting his recent meetings to the fundraiser. Twice during March 1987, Rielge voted on the Senate floor to protect funding for regulation of S&amp;L's.&nbsp;<br></p><p>As the April 2nd meeting arrived, Riegle was not in attendance. Several aides said that many of the senators in attendance were upset about this, though DeConcini testified, "we obviously weren't expecting him or else they would have waited" Laurie Sedlmayr called his office the next day and inquired about his absence at the meeting. The staff member that took her call said he didn't know anything about a meeting. Afterward, Riegle sent word to DeConcini: "please don't contact my staff on this issue" . &nbsp;The next week, Riegle received a written invitation from DeConcini and McCain (though only signed by DeConcini) to attend the April 9th meeting with the <a href="https://apps.college.brown.edu/keating5/actors/supporting_cast/sf-regulators" title="" target="">San Francisco regulators</a>. Riegle attended. On April 14th, he received the "Black Transcript" from that day's meeting from Ed Gray.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Riegle had no further contact with Keating or Lincoln Savings after that day.&nbsp;<br></p>
