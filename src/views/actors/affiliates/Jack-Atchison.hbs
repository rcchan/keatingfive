<p><u>Arthur Young accountant and Lincoln employee</u></p>

<p>Jack Atchison was the managing partner of the Phoenix office at Arthur Young,
one of (what was then) the "big eight" U.S. accounting firms. While working at
Arthur Young, he conducted a number of ACC’s external audits during the 1980s
and penned the famous "Arthur Young letter," which outlined the reasons for
his belief that the San Francisco regulators abused Lincoln S&L, an
apparently viable institution.</p>

<p>Many of the senators and their aides cited this letter as a major
motivation to contact Gray and to inquire about the Bank Board’s exam
on Keating’s behalf. In hearings on the collapse of Lincoln before the House
Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs just prior to the Keating Five
ones in the Senate, Mr. Atchison refused to testify on the basis of his Fifth
Amendment rights.</p>

<p>In 1990, Keating hired Atchison away from Arthur Young for an
annual salary of approximately $930,000.</p>
