<p>James Grogan was ACC’s chief counsel and Keating’s "right hand policy man." Grogan did a significant amount of Keating’s behind-the-scenes work in lobbying various politicians to support different bills that were beneficial to ACC and Lincoln Savings and Loan. A number of the Senators say that they or their staff dealt mostly with Grogan, not Keating, in the months surrounding the April, 1987 meetings.&nbsp;</p><p>During the Senate Ethic's Hearings, Grogan requested and was granted a private session and was granted immunity for the release of that session’s transcript into evidence.&nbsp;<br></p><p><br></p>
